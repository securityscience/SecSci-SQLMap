## üõ°Ô∏è SecSci SQLMap

This BurpSuite extension integrates the powerful `sqlmap` tool directly into BurpSuite using Python.
It enables security testers to automatically verify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by re-executing them using SQLMap, 
an automated SQL injection and database takeover tool.


## Features

- **Automatic Verification**: Automatically rescans SQL injection findings from Burp Scanner to confirm vulnerabilities.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Displays SesSci SQLMap results directly inside Burp‚Äôs Issues tab.
- **Extender API Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with BurpSuite via the Extender API.
- **Manual Execution Support**: Right-click on a target URL request and choose "Extensions ‚Üí SecSci SQLMap" to manually execute SecSci SQLMap.
- 

## Prerequisites

Before installing the extension, ensure the following:

| BurpSuite | ‚úÖ        | [Professional version](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/download-and-install)                                                        |
| Jython    | ‚úÖ        | [Download Jython](https://www.jython.org/download) (e.g., `jython-standalone-2.7.4.jar`)                                                                               |

## Set Permanent Environment Variable
Here's how to **set environment variables** on **Windows** and **Linux**:

### ü™ü Windows

#### **Temporarily (for the current terminal session only):**

```cmd
set sqlmap=sqlmap_path
```

**Example:**

```cmd
set sqlmap=C:\tools\sqlmap\sqlmap.py
```

#### **Permanently (via GUI):**

1. Press `Win + S`, search for **"Environment Variables"**, and open it.
2. Under **System Properties ‚Üí Advanced** ‚Üí click **Environment Variables**.
3. Under **User variables** or **System variables**:

   * Click **New** to create a new variable.
   * Name: `sqlmap`
   * Value: `C:\tools\sqlmap\sqlmap.py`
4. Click OK.

#### **Permanently (via Command Line ‚Äì Admin PowerShell):**

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("sqlmap", "C:\tools\sqlmap\sqlmap.py", "User")
```

To set it system-wide:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("sqlmap", "C:\tools\sqlmap\sqlmap.py", "Machine")
```

---

### üêß Linux/macOS

#### **Temporarily (for current shell session):**

```bash
export sqlmap=sqlmap_path
```

**Example:**

```bash
export sqlmap=/opt/sqlmap/sqlmap.py
```

#### **Permanently (for a specific user):**

1. Add to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile` (depending on shell):

```bash
export sqlmap=/opt/sqlmap/sqlmap.py
```

2. Then, apply the change:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # or source ~/.zshrc
```

#### **System-wide (for all users):**

- Add to `/etc/environment`:

```bash
sqlmap="/opt/sqlmap/sqlmap.py"
```

- Then reboot or run:

```bash
source /etc/environment
```


## Installation Steps

### 1. Download the Jython Standalone JAR

1. Go to [https://www.jython.org/download](https://www.jython.org/download)
2. Download the **standalone jar** (e.g. `jython-standalone-2.7.4.jar`)
3. Save the file, e.g., `jython-standalone-2.7.4.jar`, to a known location.

### 2. Enable Python Support in BurpSuite

1. Open **BurpSuite**
2. Navigate to **Extender** ‚Üí **Options**
3. Scroll to **Python Environment**
4. Click **Select file‚Ä¶**
5. Choose the download file (e.g., `jython-standalone-2.7.4.jar`)

### 3. Add the Extension

1. Download [ [zip](https://github.com/securityscience/SecSci-SQLMap/zipball/main) | [tar](https://github.com/securityscience/SecSci-SQLMap/tarball/main) ] SecSci SQLMap
   - Unzip or Untar the downloaded `SecSci-SQLMap.zip|.tar` file
2. Go to **Extender** ‚Üí **Extensions**
3. Click **Add**
4. Set:
   - **Extension Type**: Python
   - **Extension File**: `secsci_sqlmap.py`
5. Click **Next** ‚Üí then **Finish**

If successful, the extension will show `Loaded` in the table.


## Usage Instructions

Once the extension is loaded in BurpSuite:
- Default settings will be loaded, however, it can be changed by navigating to **SecSci SQLMap Settings** tab:
  ![Settings Tab](images/sqlmap-settings-tab.png)
- All SQL Injection vulnerabilities reported on Burp **Scanner ‚Üí Issues** tab will be automatically verified using SQLMap.
- Uses SQLMap command-line silently in the background with preset flags from the **SecSci SQLMap Settings** tab.
- Verified results will appear in **Target** tab ‚Üí [target_host] ‚Üí *Issues** pane with detailed output as custom findings.

- Alternatively, SQLMap can be initiated manually by right clicking an HTTP *Request* or *Response* from **Proxy**, **Repeater**, or **Target** tab.
  - Right-click a request ‚Üí choose **Extensions ‚Üí SecSci SQLMap** to run SQLMap.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                   | Solution                                                                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Extension fails to load | Make sure you‚Äôre using Python 2.7 syntax and Jython is set                             |
| sqlmap.py not found     | Ensure `sqlmap` is installed and in `sqlmap=sqlmap_path` environment variable is added |
| No scan output shown    | Check **Extender ‚Üí Output**, or use `print`/`callbacks.printOutput()`                  |
